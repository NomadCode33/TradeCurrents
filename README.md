## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ArcGIS Pro

gggggh


Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations

The resolution could be slightly shorter, as the empty space risks breaking immersion. However, it could also be seen as part of the setpiece, ultimately making it inoffensive in the long run.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
