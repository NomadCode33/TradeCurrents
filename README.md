# World Shipping in 1770
This animation provides a 2D visualization of the shipping routes of England, the Netherlands, and Spain in the year 1770, dynamically unfolding through time.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ArcGIS Pro

The data was downloaded and I opened the map. In the Properties of the Ship Positions layer, in the Time tab I selected the Filter Layer Content Based on Attribute Values and also confirmed the parameters of Layer Time that Each feature has a single time field and the Time Field as ShipDate. After confirming the settings, the time slider appears showing the time from 1/1/1770 to 12/31/1770. On the Time tab, I checked the Time Snapping Box in the Snapping group and set the units to Days. I then set the Span to 7 days, which causes the time slider to jump ahead by one week. I then turned on the Colonial Ports and Ship Paths layers in the Contents pane.

## Optimizations

The resolution could be slightly shorter, as the empty space risks breaking immersion. However, it could also be seen as part of the setpiece, ultimately making it inoffensive in the long run.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
